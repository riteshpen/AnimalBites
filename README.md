# Detailed exploratory data analysis with python 

This is the very first inferential statistics explanatory data analysis I have done on my own. 

I'm open to all improvements (even rewording), don't hesitate to comment or follow if you found it useful. 

If I'm completely wrong somewhere or if my findings are unclear, don't hesitate to comment.

This dataset was selected [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mmujtabah/animal-bites-analysis/input)

The purpose of this EDA is to find insights that will serve us later in another notebook for Data cleaning/preparation/transformation which will ultimately be used in a machine-learning algorithm. We will proceed as follow:

In this data analysis, I will not only be visualizing data through statistical modeling and cleaning up data. 

However, I will be performing hypothesis tests to see if the vaccination time between dogs and cats is significant and ANOVA to see if there is 
a significant difference between the species and vaccination time.
